Peer's repository:  https://github.com/jsievert73/03-Text-adventure-1.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned a method on how to map a health system in the json files.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
How to implement additional actions besides movement; something I struggled with in my project.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
For actions such as inventory or attack, have a quicker way of giving the command.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
There were little to no comments in the main.py. Should have commented each function.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
How the "USE" command works. I couldn't figure out if the use command required an additional line for the item,
automatically searched the inventory, or was simular with movement.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Make it clearer that the game.json is the correct file to run, since there are still the other game
files in the repo.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Besides these minor "issues" its fantastic. Pretty much only criticized the code cause I had to,
otherwise impressive work.
